  // We used this same mode in 41100a44, then changed detached readers to `anchorTo: "start"` after
  // virtual-core 3.17.4 could misclassify transient end distance and pull the viewport downward.
  // Upstream 3.17.6 fixed viewport-spanning streaming growth (#1236), and 3.17.7 made resize
  // compensation and row transforms commit in the same frame (#1239). Do not restore the old
  // dynamic anchor, custom size predicate, or manual scrollTop compensation: each overrides the
  // now-correct core transaction and recreates the jump that those releases removed.
  //
  // This config belongs only to the unbounded outer Agent timeline. Bounded diff and command
  // outputs own separate inner scrollports and must never drive this virtualizer.
